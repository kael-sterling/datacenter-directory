# datacenter-directory
Declarative identity governance for Active Directory, Exchange-style attributes, shared mailbox departments, and strict group membership enforcement. This repository implements a clean, deterministic identity model using CSV-driven provisioning and a unified configuration system.

The repo contains two major components:

1. **IdentityProvisioning Module**  
   Declarative user and group provisioning for AD DS.

2. **Provisioning Engine for Shared Mailboxes**  
   Declarative mailbox and group membership provisioning using strict desired-state enforcement.

Both systems follow the same IaC philosophy: identity is code, provisioning is deterministic, and drift is eliminated.

# IdentityProvisioning Module

The `IdentityProvisioning` module provisions and maintains AD DS user and group objects using declarative CSV files and a unified configuration file (`identity.json`). It enforces identity attributes, manages non-identity attributes with governed overwrite rules, generates proxyAddresses across multiple domains, and maintains group membership and nesting.

See the module-level README in `IdentityProvisioning/README.md` for full details.

# Provisioning Engine

This directory contains the top-level provisioning workflow for shared mailboxes and directory groups. It includes:

- `Run-MailboxProvisioning.ps1` — the orchestration wrapper
- `shared_mailboxes.csv` — base/empty desired-state definition for mailboxes
- `shared_mailboxes_example.csv` — fictional example mailbox definitions
- `group_membership.csv` — base/empty desired-state definition for group membership (auto-generated if missing)
- `group_membership_example.csv` — fictional example group membership definitions

---

## Run-MailboxProvisioning.ps1

This wrapper:

1. Resolves CSV paths
2. Imports all provisioning scripts from subdirectories
3. Provisions mailboxes and groups
4. Enforces strict group membership
5. Supports DryRun mode

It ensures all provisioning logic runs in a predictable, idempotent order.

### Example

```powershell
pwsh ./Run-MailboxProvisioning.ps1 -MailboxesCsvPath ./shared_mailboxes.csv -DryRun
```

# CSV Files

## shared_mailboxes.csv (base/empty)

This is the **real CSV** used by the provisioning engine.  
It ships empty:

```
Name,PrimarySmtp,Aliases,Folders,Description,Department,HideFromGAL,GroupDescription
```

Users populate this file with their actual mailbox definitions.

This file drives:

- mailbox creation
- mailbox rename detection
- metadata drift correction
- alias enforcement
- folder creation
- group naming conventions

---

## shared_mailboxes_example.csv (fictional)

A fully fictional example demonstrating the correct schema, naming conventions, and metadata fields.

This file is provided only as a reference and is safe for public repositories.

---

## group_membership.csv (base/empty)

This file ships empty:

```
Group,Members
```

If empty or missing, the provisioning script will **auto-generate a complete membership skeleton** based on the mailboxes defined in `shared_mailboxes.csv`.

Groups follow the naming convention:

- `SG_<MailboxName>_FullAccess`
- `SG_<MailboxName>_SendAs`

Members are semicolon-separated UPNs.

---

## group_membership_example.csv (fictional)

A fictional example showing how group membership should be structured, including semicolon-separated UPNs and realistic (but non-identifying) group names.

This file is provided only as a reference and is safe for public repositories.

# **Philosophy**

`datacenter-directory` treats identity as code.

Every run enforces a deterministic identity model, eliminates drift, and ensures AD DS remains consistent with declarative configuration. The system is:

* Predictable  
* Repeatable  
* Idempotent  
* Auditable  
* Easy to extend

This repo is designed to be a homelab-grade identity system built with enterprise IAM principles.
